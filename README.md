# Comp436FinalProject

Hello! Here you will find my source files for my "Serotonin Booster" Final Project. I created my website using react with five different APIs and included a wholesome (and self-made) game of Connect Four. The games were quite tedious to build, but I'm happy with how they turned out! I hope you enjoy!

Thanks for both a great semester and for stopping by!
